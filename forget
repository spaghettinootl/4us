when you know, you know,
and i knew that i knew,
but now you say i must forget you.
maybe it's best to forget,
but it's so hard to let go.
falling for you was so easy

who would have known
 letting go 
wouldn't be?

i hadn't known
 letting go
wouldn't be.

goodbye maria,
i love you dearly.
maybe one day you'll rejoin me.
im hoping one day you'll rejoin me.
please, one day, rejoin me.
