if you ever want to try again,
you know i'll be here waiting.

if you meet another guy again,
i know, it's fine. i'm waiting.

and if you never want to try again,
fine.
you might change your mind,
right?
i'll still be waiting.

you may have given up,
but i'll never let go.
i'll always have hope,
as long as you know
i love you.
